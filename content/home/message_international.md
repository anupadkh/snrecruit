Dear Valued Clients,
Warm Greetings from the land of the Himalayas, Nepal.
We the S.N. Recruiting Services Pvt. Ltd believes in the essence of the said words. Our much strength will be brought in synergy to help us do our job better. We are determined to enhance our ability to enable us to respond more rapidly to the fast changing international development of the recruitment landscape.
Today, writing the message gives me immense pleasure. We have converted every moment into a success in the past years. With hard works, dedication, sense of selfless service and high spirited team, we have made difference in Nepalese manpower industry.
Together with our committed and professional staff, the work entrusted to our company will move steadily and successfully forward.
Today, foreign employment backs Nepal’s miniscule agricultural economy and my country depends now on remittance that comes from foreign employment. This has emerged as an ultimate option among Nepalese youth seeking to enter job market.
I, as a Nepalese national involved in promotion of foreign employment, am proud to express a few thoughts on this subject. I think, the credit to establish foreign employment as a respected industry goes to the employers in international labor market giving prominence to Nepalese workers.
Our mission to help Nepalese live a better life guides us in promoting their skills and knowledge and become recognize as indispensable quality workforce abroad.
“As  the Director of this company, I look forward to position S.N. Recruiting Services Pvt. Ltd. Nepal on a long term growth and to give more value to our clients and partners as the core of our business.”
Thank you!
With Best Regards,
Dato’ Ram
